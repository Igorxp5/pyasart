# PyAsArt

This module provides functionality to convert Python source code files into executable BMP images. The resulting BMP images are compatible with BMP file readers while still containing the original Python source code and be executed in the terminal.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to address the challenge of embedding Python source code into a BMP file format. The BMP file specification requires specific signature bytes at the beginning of the file, which conflicts with Python's requirement for specifying the encoding on the first line. This project provides a solution by converting the Python source code into a BMP image while preserving its executable nature.

### Key Features
- **Source Code Embedding:** Converts Python source code into an image that adheres to BMP file format specifications.
- **Executable BMP File:** The BMP file generated remains executable and can be interpreted by Python.

## Pre-requisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**
- **Pillow (PIL)**
- **Colour (colour-science)**
- **Pygments**

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Igorxp5/pyasart
```
### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd pyasart
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### 4. Generate a BMP Image from Python Source Code

You can now convert a Python source file to a BMP image using the `main.py` script:

```bash
python -m pyasart.main <input_file> <output_file>
```

- `<input_file>`: Path to the Python source file you want to convert.
- `<output_file>`: Path where the resulting BMP image will be saved.

### Example

To convert a Python file named `fibonacci.py` to an image `code_fibonacci.bmp`, run:

```bash
python -m pyasart.main fibonacci.py code_fibonacci.bmp
```

#### Source code

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sequence


def main():
    # Number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
    n = 10
    
    # Get the Fibonacci sequence
    fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(n)
    
    # Iterate over each number in the sequence
    for number in fib_sequence:
        # Print the current Fibonacci number
        print(number)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Resulting Image

![code_fibonacci](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b47621cd-847e-4cd2-9baf-1a9168c9f069)

**Note: The above image is not in BMP format. GitHub does not allow to upload BMP files to Markdown files. Hence, downloading the image and trying to run it in Python interpreter won't work.**

#### Running code

```bash
$ python code_fibonacci.bmp
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

## Warning

**Be cautious when running BMP files through the Python interpreter, especially if you do not know the source of the image. Executing code embedded in a BMP file could potentially be harmful if the source code contains malicious content.**

**Before running any BMP file through Python, you should inspect the embedded source code. To do this, open the BMP file in a text editor. The Python source code in images generated by this project will be located at the end of the file.**
